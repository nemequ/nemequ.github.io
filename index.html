      <h2>Open Source Projects</h2>

      <p>
        An incomplete list of open-source projects I am, or have been
        involved with, in no particular order.  Unless otherwise noted,
        I'm the original author and current maintainer.
      </p>

      <dl class="project-list">
        <dt>
	  <a href="https://github.com/simd-everywhere/simde/">SIMDe</a>
	</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            SIMDe provides portable implementations of intrinsics
            for <abbr title="Single Instruction Multiple
            Data">SIMD</abbr> <abbr title="Instruction Set
            Architecture">ISA</abbr> extensions, allowing you to to
            run code written for an ISA extension (such
            as <abbr title="Streaming SIMD Extensions">SSE</abbr>) on
            a machine which does not support it, such as an ARM CPU,
            or just an x86 CPU without that specific ISA extension.
            There is no performance penalty for using SIMDe instead of
            using the native intrinsics directly if the CPU supports
            it.
          </p>
	  <p>
	    SIMDe currently implements several thousand functions from
	    various x86 APIs, NEON, SVE, and WASM SIMD128.  Please see
	    the project for an up-to-date list.

        <dt>
      	  <a href="/hedley/">Hedley</a>
	</dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Hedley is a personal favorite.  It is a C/C++ header you
            can include in your project to enable compiler specific
            features while maintaining compatibility, with a focus on
            making your <abbr>API</abbr> harder to misuse by providing
            hints to compilers and static analyzers.
          </p>
          <p>
            When I start a C project these days, adding Hedley is usually
            the first thing I do.
          </p>

        <dt>
      	  <a href="https://github.com/nemequ/wav">WAV</a>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            WAV is an alternative to the WASM SIMD128 C API
            (wasm_simd128.h), with a focus on safety and usability.
            It aims to be easy to use correctly and hard to use
            incorrectly without sacrificing performance.  It's a small
            project, but lots of fun.

            An assortment portable code snippets (in C, though they

            compiler-specific or platform-specific.

              standard C implementations.  Provides both accelerated ond portable
              implementations of both GCC and MSVC built-ins/intrinsics, as well
              fixed-length versions.  Sort of like SIMDe for scalar code.

            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="subproject-name">debug-trap</span> —

            <li>
              <span class="subproject-name">endian</span> —
              the most complete endianness detection and swapping code I'm aware of.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="subproject-name">exact-int</span> —
              exact-width integer types (think &lt;stdint.h&gt;, but
              more portable).  Hopefully no longer necessary.
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
            <li>

              random number generation (3 flavors: cryptographic, reproducible, and fast)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            All modules work on Linux, Windows, OS X, BSD, Solaris, <i>etc.</i>, on all architectures
            I've been able to test.  Most should work on any C89+ compliant compiler, though
            they can also take advantage of specific compilers/platforms.

          <p>
            Squash is primarily an abstraction layer which provides a
            single API to access many compression libraries. This
            allows applications a great deal of flexibility in which
            choosing a compression algorithm, or allowing a choice
            between several of them.
          </p>
          <p>
            The actual integration with individual compression
            libraries is done through plugins which can be installed
            separately from Squash itself and are not loaded until
            they are required. This allows Squash consumers to utilize
            many compression algorithms without rewriting code or
            unnecessary bloat.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition to a permissively licensed (MIT) library, Squash
            provides some generic tools which use the library for
            common tasks. Currently, this includes a command-line
            interface similar
            to <var>gzip</var>, <var>bzip2</var>, <var>xz</var>, <i>etc.</i>
            called <var>squash</var> and a benchmarking tool.  There
            is also a
            web-based <a href="https://quixdb.github.io/squash-benchmark/">benchmark</a>,
            and <a href="https://github.com/nemequ/compfuzz">a project to fuzz</a>
            various compression libraries.

        <dd>
          <p>
            µnit is a small and portable testing framework for C which
            includes pretty much everything you might expect from a C
            testing framework, plus a few pleasant surprises, wrapped
            in a nice API.
          </p>
	  <p>
	    I still really like the API and the feature set, but it
	    could use a rewrite; the implementation is a bit of a
	    mess.

          <p>
            TinyCThread is a cross-platform implementation of the C11
            threading API which uses POSIX threads (pthreads) or the
            Windows API, allowing you to use the standard C11 API on
            systems which don&#8217;t natively support it.

          <p class="involvement">
            This was initially created by Marcus Geelnard, I finished
            implementing the API and took over maintenance.

            Vala is a new programming language that aims to bring
            modern programming language features to GNOME developers
            without imposing any additional runtime requirements and
            without using a different ABI compared to applications and
            libraries written in C.
          </p>
          <p>
            Vala was created by Jürg Billeter.  I maintained the bindings
            to third-party libraries (which effectively formed the standard
            library) for several years.

          <p>
            Bump is a library designed to make asynchronous
            programming easy by providing high-level data structures
            for concurrency management, including multi-threading and
            main loop callbacks, in GObject/GIO based projects,
            especially those written in Vala.

          <p>
            SQLHeavy is a wrapper on top of SQLite with a
            GObject-based interface, providing very nice APIs for C
            and Vala, GObject Introspection support, and additional
            functionality not present in SQLite.
